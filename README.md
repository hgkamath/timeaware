#Time Aware
Install app from Google [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ganasoft.timeaware)

For some activities, one may find it useful to be reminded of the time and the task at hand.
TimeAware can be configured to speak various sentences at different minutes. 
TimeAware uses TTS (Text to speech) to read the entered sentences aloud. TimeAware can help improve concentration and reduce mind drift, by providing an audio trigger. The trigger could be as simple as just saying the time or saying something else to motivate. 

permissions: The app does not require permissions.
